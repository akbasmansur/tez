SGK yazılımlarının(yaşam döngüsü, deployu a'sı b'si neyse) kendine özgü bir durumu varsa teze ekle

mesela kurumun çoğunda java kullanılıyor. Bir geçişte bunun nasıl etkileri olur veya olur mu?

On top of this, you must continue to meet the needs of the old system for a while, solve its errors, make new improvements, and continue to develop the new system. 
Since the two require different mindsets, you must be able to move back and forth from one to the other. This going back and forth will obviously waste time.

To ensure orchestration within asynchronous structures, you must integrate new technologies, discard old ones, and start the testing processes from the beginning.
You should write all unit and integration tests from scratch.
You should even change your testing logic and start testing by taking physical errors such as connection problems into account.

With automatic testing tools, flexible load balancers, installation of virtualization architectures and ensuring their security, there is a lot of dev-ops work that most developers do not like.

The research I will do will be a preliminary research on the transition of some programs in government institutions to microservice architecture.
Considering the above information, answer the following questions.
What might be the requirements in a government institution that has not used microservice architecture before?
